<p>I recently had a discussion with the VP of engineering at my current company.<br />
Unsurprisingly, we were gently arguing over learning natural languages vs learning programming languages.<br />
Over a beer (I thought this is important for setting the context) and a halloumi burger (also important).</p>
<p>Empirically, I feel the common denominator to most of what I learn is my love for patterns.</p>
<p>Not that it's important, but here is a non-exhaustive list:<br />
Social psychology: study of patterns in thoughts, feelings, and behaviors as influenced by the presence of others.<br />
Puzzle/detective games, books and shows: any games where a mystery has to be solved.<br />
eg. The Raven - Legacy of a Master Thief, Black Closet, ...<br />
Detective tabletop RPGs and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_mystery_game" target="_blank">Murder Mystery game nights</a>.<br />
The Sherlock Holmes Canon, etc, etc, etc, you get the idea.</p>
<p>Now, languages:<br />
I studied Latin as a child and I knew my interest for it could not have been communication or pleasure in pronunciation - it's a dead language. I realised I liked it because I knew it had a structure which I acknowledged and which helped deconstruct it for translation. I could also deconstruct/parse any word from my native language based on Latin and the shreds of Greek I have acquired over time. Languages are like a puzzle game. Figuring out where things go and what their permissions are (like a three-dimensional chess).</p>
<p>I could link a zillion articles to the benefits of learning.<br />
I could link a zillion on top relating to the benefits of learning languages.<br />
Maybe not a zillion, k.<br />

<p>Fast forward to university. One day, I was dozing through a linguistics class when the professor started drawing some strange glyphs on the board.<br />
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2000px-Basic_english_syntax_tree.svg.png" alt="Generative Grammar" width="200" height="223" /><br />
And some more - vaguely reminding me of arithmetic and geometric progressions.<br />
I rubbed my eyes, I was still studying English for sure. I had simply become acquainted with the work of a contemporary genius, namely <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noam_Chomsky" target="_blank">Noam Chomsky</a>.</p>
<p>What is interesting in this generative grammar theory of his (I am not pretending to be anywhere close to an expert) is how it struck me as a programmatic construct.<br />
This stayed with me. It triggers a whole lot of questions.<br />
Are these constructs led by rules born out of human chaos/fancy?<br />
Or is there something more deterministic based on our context/dependencies (inc. brain capacities, environment, etc)?<br />
This is more in line with what he looks at in his universal grammar moving towards...<br />
the last bit of his work - minimalist program. Not grammar, you got that right, PROGRAM.</p>
<p>Natural language as a system based on economy produced by plastic cerebral circuits.</p>
<p>I am not saying natural and programming languages are the same but they are related.<br />
If their similarities help understand the other, it must thereby also help with learning the other.</p>

<p>I would love to hear your opinion on the matter, especially as I sense this might be a very simplistic post on a very rich subject.</p>
