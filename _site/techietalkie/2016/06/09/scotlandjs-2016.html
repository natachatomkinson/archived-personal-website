    <p>Thursday June 2nd is a very sunny day, I have definitely overpacked and overdressed. It must be 20+˚C and I am in ... Edinburgh.<br />
I have flown from London the day before.<br />
What for? To attend <a href="http://scotlandjs.com/">ScotlandJS</a>, courtesy of Codebar and ScotlandJS.<br />
I do use JS a lot by day, even though I secretly expand my love and knowledge of Ruby by night. I honestly didn't know what to expect but with a touch of bravado and fake nonchalance, I walked to the Dynamic Earth venue hosting the 2-day event.<br />
From an architecture point of view, it's a more than impressive venue. I follow the trail of people gently walking up to the entrance, feeling more and more like on a first day at school.<br />
All of a sudden, uncool because on my own, not belonging because reasons, sweaty because of the warmth and my jumper. As I enter, the first thing that catches my eye is the code of conduct: 'no &lt;insertgroup&gt;phobia' repeated over and over and over on a big banner stand. My anxiety recedes. No bully in sight. Smiles everywhere, I feel better already. One of the volunteers welcomes me and hands me a name tag/schedule leaflet all packed in one - clever and efficient. Yellow lanyard for picture consent - why didn't I pick the purple?</p>
<p>I walk in, lured by coffee and viennoiseries. I almost don't understand how but I introduce myself to another girl, living and working in Edinburgh, also on her own for these 2 days. So if only for that, thanks because her company was awesome and this was just the start.<br />
What a start - <a href="https://twitter.com/misslivirose">Liv Erickson</a> (@misslivirose) from Microsoft tackles VR, the why and the how. It's 9, I am barely awake, yet leaning in, captivated. So much so that, by the end of the talk, I feel like leaving to go play with <a href="https://aframe.io/">A-frame</a>.<br />
I am wondering how the following speaker will manage to keep my attention levels even half that high. <a href="https://twitter.com/jemyoung">Jem Young</a> (@JemYoung) from Netflix talking about service workers does the trick. <a href="https://twitter.com/Charlotteis">Charlotte Spencer</a> (@Charlotteis) does an amazing job at highlighting why opensource needs to be inclusive and pay attention to the language used. They also discuss the importance of naps. Language *is* important. As a non-native speaker (among other quirks), this is spot-on. I even find myself interested in MIDI when discussed by <a href="https://twitter.com/Rumyra">Ruth John</a> (@Rumyra), as passionate and convincing as <a href="https://twitter.com/KimCrayton1">Kim Crayton</a> (@KimCrayton1) on Overcoming the Challenges of Mentoring. Every 3 talks, we are invited to a break upstairs called 'discussion tracks' to address any further question we have on a given topic. I realise how dedicated and nice these speakers must be. Being (even gently) quizzed by peers is very intense and quite a commitment. Kudos to them.<br />
<a href="https://twitter.com/mattpodwysocki">Matthew Podwysocki</a> (@mattpodwysocki) on Async programming and <a href="https://twitter.com/dan_jenkins">Dan Jenkins</a> (@dan_jenkins) on Getting physical with Web Bluetooth sure know how to use props. Berlin-based <a href="https://twitter.com/misprintedtype">Ola Gasidlo</a> (@misprintedtype) gives some very good insight on offline and some of its challenges. <a href="https://twitter.com/kitation">Chad</a> (@kitation) ponders on when it's okay to ask about gender and how to do it. I had thought about what to put in the dreaded drop-down but had never actually questioned the validity of the question altogether. <a href="https://twitter.com/substack">James Halliday</a> (@substack) hops on stage with a hat I thought - wrongly probably - a tribute to Jayne from Serenity. He discussed a fairer world by describing his P2P work off the grid. If I have to be honest, I would quit my job and go for strappy sandals and funky hat if I had a project and an experience comparable to his. I was impressed and inspired. Not every part of this planet faces the same technological challenges.<br />
<a href="https://twitter.com/rmehner">Robin Mehner</a> (@rmehner) on Surviving Javascript makes me laugh a lot. I love his approach to coding and his appeal for more humility and inclusion in the community. He also addresses the adopt/know-it-all race. I did share more with Robin on the topic at the after-party on Friday, he also got me almost convinced to move to Berlin. I mean it's a cool city, so it wouldn't take much convincing.<br />
<a href="https://twitter.com/Rumyra">Ruth John</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/TimPietrusky">Tim Pietrusky</a> (@TimPietrusky) treat all of us to a 'nerd disco' at the end of Day 1. By that point, it gets surreal to be here, having fun with tech and like-minded people.<br />
My brain then gets really fuzzy about chronology. I continue to see friendly faces and hear interesting voices talking about HTTP/2, cognitive biases when coding, mining your own data (including some guessing games which I resisted to participate to the HTTP/2 track - that was...hard), accessibility, electron, how big tv screens are mobile screens you can't touch at a 10ft distance, cellular automata and fear.<br />
I get fully, entirely, completely starstruck by <a href="https://twitter.com/ceejbot">CJ Silverio</a> (@ceejbot) from npm talking about 'Monitoring on a budget' - my awesomeness sensors are off the charts and I feel like a very very small dev in very very big uber cool pond.</p>
<p>The team at ScotlandJS was funny, caring and organised. Everything went seamlessly (or was well hidden, same difference). The talks were as inspiring as content-rich.</p>
<p>My personal take-aways:<br />
Coding is ultimately about people, welcome/include everyone.<br />
Take a breath and a nap and be the best you can be. Don't compete with others, compete with older versions of you.<br />
Numbats, wombats and Jedis rock.</p>
<p>If I have not yet convinced you to buy your tickets for next year, I just know I will and I truly hope to see you there.</p>
