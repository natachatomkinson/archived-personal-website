<p>Or so it seems.</p>
<p>Upon discussing the matter of recruitment, I was advised by a clojure-lover friend of mine to try my logical skills at fizzbuzz.</p>
<p>Apparently, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz" target="_blank">fizzbuzz is quite big here in the UK</a>.<br />
High chances it's big in the rest of the world too - it's meant to teach children about division.<br />
I no longer qualify as a child but I do qualify as someone who has to prove their coding skills.</p>
<blockquote><p>Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100.<br />
But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”.<br />
For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.</p></blockquote>
<p>My first attempt was working but unsatisfactory. I googled to find whether there was a more elegant solution and - lo and behold - there was!<br />
To save you the trouble, here it is in Ruby with a slight modification as I was also playing with arguments passed from the shell.</p>
<pre lang="LANGUAGE" line="1">#assign an argument passed via shell/terminal/cli to n or by default 100
n = ARGV[0] || 100
#repeat up to nth time
#what you choose via shell/terminal/cli or the default value of 100
#i is a token/dummy value which represents each incremental iteration
#you could call it diplodocus for all it matters
(1..n).each{|i|
#x is what we will print as a result, upon starting, it's blank!
x = ''
#assign string Fizz to x if i is a multiple of 3
x += 'Fizz' if i%3==0
x += 'Buzz' if i%5==0

#if x is not a multiple of 5 or 3 and is thus empty at that point
#just print the iteration instead ie. count
#otherwise print what's been assigned to x(either Fizz or Buzz or FizzBuzz)
puts(x.empty? ? i : x);
}</pre>
<p>This is not the ultimate solution - just the one that struck me by its simplicity.<br />
I have added a lot of comments because my post is not necessarily aimed at an expert audience.<br />
And frankly, I also appreciate when people try to be as clear as possible.<br />
It really helps understanding.</p>
<p>One of the principles of Ruby is <em>there's more than one way to do something</em>.<br />
It is rich and challenging because the coder has the responsibility for finding out the best way in their given context.<br />
This implies a good level of creativity and the ability to re-calibrate the way you think to look at the problem from different angles.</p>
<p>The strange thing is I can sense whenever I am writing some cluttered code.<br />
I know that from the moment I repeat some patterns, I feel like I have lost the game.<br />
Looking back at my code snippets, I often have a sense of gratification widely outweighed by frustration. And such a desire to do more and better!</p>
<p>This blog is one way to explore the reasons behind why I have decided at this point in life to become a full-time developer.<br />
It's meant to be self-exploratory, possibly witty and most certainly silly at times.</p>
