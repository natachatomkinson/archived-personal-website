<p>My days are spent learning. Failing that - craving to learn.<br />
I do my utmost to learn as much as possible at work.<br />
When I go home, I either binge on tv shows or go online and learn some more.<br />
If you want to know why, I will retrofit a link to the post on why I learn so much - learn until I am drained and stressed and sometimes cranky.</p>
<p>My time is most spent on:<br />
- <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/" target="_blank">Duolingo</a> which has <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/luis_von_ahn_massive_scale_online_collaboration" target="_blank">an awesome Ted Talk associated with</a>. I giggled quite a lot.<br />
<a href="https://twitter.com/luisvonahn?lang=en" target="_blank">Luis von Ahn</a> also worked on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAPTCHA" target="_blank">captcha</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReCAPTCHA" target="_blank">recaptcha</a></p>
<p>- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EdX" target="_blank">edX</a> created by no less than the MIT and Harvard University.<br />
- <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">codecademy</a> back when it was really free - which should be camelCase if you think about it!<br />
- <a href="https://www.coursera.org/" target="_blank">Coursera</a> which comes with <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/daphne_koller_what_we_re_learning_from_online_education" target="_blank">a good Ted Talk too</a><br />
- <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank">Stack Overflow</a> where you'd better be prepared to read 12 pdfs on how to post if you would like not get flamed straight away<br />
- all the blogs documenting great code along with clear explanations which I stumble upon when I google<br />
- Wikipedia where I learnt an awful lot about regexes (come on, I am not going to link that)</p>
<p>Duolingo is a platform that stands out by its purpose, design, apparently simple yet impeccable code.<br />
I have used every day for the past years and I have never had any reason to complain, only reasons to praise this app whether on web or handheld device.</p>
