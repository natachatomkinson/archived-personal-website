As a beginner to Javascript, I had the luck to be provided with similar resources by a caring senior developer.

The purpose of this post is to give back and offer any new comer to Javascript and/or ES6 resources to help them.


## How to use

The resources have been selected for the scope they cover and clarity they offer. They are not exhaustive.

If something doesn't make sense, search, ask, read again. Scaffolding is the best way to learn.

It's not about the deep dive without oxygen. Toe dipping is the way to go. And incrementally from there.
